# [Airbnb Analysis - Customer Success team](https://lookerstudio.google.com/reporting/9baf93a3-eb10-420e-9440-858ae90347e4)

This project has been made during my studies as a result of a team project on Looker Studio.
An overall analysis has been conducted on the given dataset to find patterns and trends that could answer to the question: _Why are some hosts renting more than others?_

Details:
* Dataset: Public Airbnb dataset provided during the Data Analytics bootcamp
* Tools used: Looker Studio + Google docs for tasks alignment
